ThoughtsForGary
===============

Random Busey, Random Nietzche. What more could you want?


If you're just looking for the runnable version of the program and don't care about the source code, then you want "Thoughts for Gary.Zip."  Just unzip and run the .jar file from the command line. Windows users can also get "ThoughtsForGaryBuseyWindows.zip" instead and run the .exe file.

If you want to change what quotes or pictures come up you can do so by adding files to the Images folder or adding lines to the quotes.txt file.  Just make sure that every file in the Images folder is a valid image within a reasonable size range (no more than 600px or so in height) and that every quote is on its own line in the text file.

Enjoy!





All images and quotes were gathered from around the internet without permission from anybody.  If you are somebody with an ownership claim to any of these things then you should totally be cool about it because, I mean, c'mon man it's all good.

If you are one of said persons and you disagree, then send me a cease and desist order and if you have a valid claim I'll cease and/or desist.

My Email address is benburum@gmail.com.  I'd love to hear any thoughts people have about the program, although preferably not if they're the angry lawyer type of thoughts.
